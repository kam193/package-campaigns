(or be generated by AI? This seems to be AI-related thing).\n\nThis package (and others from this user) has no real content and seems to be generated by a tool https://github.com/jvlax/vibehat to prevent \"dependency confusion\", but the scanner takes every local dependency and every non-relative import (https://github.com/jvlax/vibehat/blob/eed43b24b17ba393efc1b4e06aa7f9413559831a/backend/github_scanner.py#L345).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: SPAM - advertisements, spam packages etc.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-07-vibehat\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - other\n\n",
