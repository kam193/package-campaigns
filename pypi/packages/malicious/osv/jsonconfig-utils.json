    "details": "During installation, package installs a script that listens for remote commands and executes them. The script is also added to autostart configuration and disguised as system application\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-02-devtools-webhook-cicd-utils\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n\n - peristence-autorun\n\n\n - The package contains code to execute remote commands (probably limited to a specific set) on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n",
