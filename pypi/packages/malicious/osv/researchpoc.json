    "details": "Package mentions being a research PoC, probably for dependency confusion, but the code is obfuscated making verification of the claim impossible.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: GENERIC-questionable-pentest\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - exfiltration-env-variables\n\n\n - exfiltration-generic\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n",
