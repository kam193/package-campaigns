    "details": "Running the installed entry point downloads and executes remote code. During the analysis, the code was switching to websockets, adding a startup script and downloading next stages, which finally looked for browser and crypto wallet data. Currently, they seem not to attempt exfiltration of very sensitive data but rather a presence of different webbrowsers and wallets.\n\nIt uses the same remote domain as campaign 2025-07-db-indicator, but significantly different payload.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\nCampaign: 2025-07-backtradingbot\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.\n - peristence_autorun\n - exfiltration_browser_data\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n - crypto-related",
