    "details": "Campaign is split into multiple packages that altogether exfiltrates data from desktop Telegram application.\n\n1. \"pyapiepo\" is a cover package that provides some useless features BUT also imports \"zscaner\"\n2. \"zscaner\", when imported, automatically runs a function that is an entry point to the whole process; it uses the \"scan\" from \"reqinstall\" to walk through directories. The package also provides main logic: filtering files, triggering archiving directories and exfiltrating them. \n3. \"reqinstall\" ensures \"requests\" are installed and provides a directory tree scanning function.\n4. \"zmaker\" provides functions to build archives from collected files.\n5. \"zsender\" provides functions to exfiltrate data, the remote URL and a function to deobfuscate configuration in other packages.\n\nAltogether, they look for \"Telegram Desktop\" folder, archive user data stored there and exfiltrate to a remote location.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-04-zscaner\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - target:telegram\n\n\n - exfiltration-generic\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n",
