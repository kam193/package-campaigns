They are identified as malicious by VT and the tracks of Telegram URLs suggests attempting data exfiltration. The package itself looks like a copy of requests.\nIn flophttp, using exactly the same obfuscation method, the infostealer is directly embeded into package code and exfiltrates data to a telegram channel.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\nCampaign: 2024-08-invokehttp\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - {}\n - {'description': 'Downloads and executes a remote executable.'}\n - {'theme': 'warning'}\n - {'theme': 'info', 'description': 'The package is a clone of a real package, but with malicious code added.'}",
