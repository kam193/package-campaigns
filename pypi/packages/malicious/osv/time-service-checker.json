    "details": "This campaign is built from two parts:\n1) packages named like time-check-server, snapshot-photo contain an innocent-looking code that sends \"date\" to a remote server,\n2) packages named like alicloud-client are clones of legit aliyun-python-sdk-core package, with a small change in the client.py code, where it imports the time-check-server and calls it, but instead of a date, the credentials to the cloud are exfiltrated. There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - The package is a clone of a real package, but with malicious code added.\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n - exfiltration_cloud_tokens",
