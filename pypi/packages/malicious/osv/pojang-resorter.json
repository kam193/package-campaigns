    "details": "Early versions used overriding install command to take screenshots, then it moved to automated installing an infostealer. Later the behaviour was changed and looks like being a toolkit to install malware, yet, depending on version, containing an automated infostealer installation. The exact code is partially hidden behind different obfuscation methods.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\nCampaign: 2024-08-pojang-resorter\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - infostealer\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n - \n - Downloads and executes a remote executable.\n - obfuscation\n - exfiltration_generic",
