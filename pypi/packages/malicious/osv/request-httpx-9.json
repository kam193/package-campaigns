    "details": "The package contains a Telegram bot running allowing for remote access. This functionality is disclosed in the readme, but the package name clearly indicates it's either a dependency confusion attempt or it's intended to be hidden from the user in the installed environment.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-02-request-httpx-4\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n\n - The package contains code to execute remote commands (probably limited to a specific set) on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - files-exfiltration\n\n",
