Designed to look like created by different organisations, they contain a couple of data exfiltration (including all env variables) and potential remote code execution (though the URL seems not to serve any code).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-05-sl4x01\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - exfiltration-env-variables\n\n\n - impersonation\n\n",
