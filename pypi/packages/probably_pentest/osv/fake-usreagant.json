    "summary": "Pentesting or research code in fake-usreagant (PyPI)",
    "details": "Package imitates the legitimate fake-useragent, however it has a few suspicious additions: fake.py L149 calls a function from 'urllib2' module, which contains a code attempting to JSON-deserialize encoded code. This is a pickle executing os.system(id), which of course isn't executed by json.loads, but would be by pickle. Also: action is suspicious, not really malicious, but the package is a clear typosquatting attempt.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2024-10-old-fake-usreagant\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n - The package is a clone of a real package, but with malicious code added.\n - typosquatting\n - dependency-confusion",
