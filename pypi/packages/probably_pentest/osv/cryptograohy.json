    "details": "The pyprettifier library has a feature to send out the user home path throuh the logger. It's attached to the __init__ of EmojiConverter class. Other related packages utilize a typosquatting to imitate real packages, and attempts to call the EmojiConverter from pyprettifier, triggering notifying the author about the user's home path.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2024-09-pyprettifier\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - typosquatting\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.",
