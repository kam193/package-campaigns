    "details": "It appears to be a forgotten pentest checking typosquatting against cobo-custody package, but may also have malicious purposes. During installation, if a machine is Mac, an obfuscated code attempts to download and execute a shell script. Currently, the server does not respond.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-old-cobo-sectest\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote executable.\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - crypto-related\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n",
