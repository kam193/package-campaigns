Thus, it's rather just an experiment\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2025-05-caixaequ2ahzoop\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - obfuscation\n - The package contains code to execute remote commands (probably limited to a specific set) on the victim's machine.",
