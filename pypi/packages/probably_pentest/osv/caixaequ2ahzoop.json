    "details": "Obfuscated code gets a command from the remote target and executes it. At the time of the test, it was just \"whoami\". Thus, it's rather just an experiment\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-05-caixaequ2ahzoop\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - The package contains code to execute remote commands (probably limited to a specific set) on the victim's machine.\n\n",
