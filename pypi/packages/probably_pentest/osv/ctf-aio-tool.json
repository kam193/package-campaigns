    "details": "Installing the package starts a reverse shell. The remote server is, however, set as a local IP, so it's most probably testing\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2025-03-marinff\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n - obfuscation\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.",
