    "details": "During installation, a website with the current working dir is being called. It looks like something between spam and pentest as the website is most probably not in the control of the uploader. The package has no other purpose\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-04-byted-torch-monitor\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n",
