    "details": "Obfuscated code is used to hide exfiltration of basic data (hostname, etc.).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-02-zabitmajeed00\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n",
