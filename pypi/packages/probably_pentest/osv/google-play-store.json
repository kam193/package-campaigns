    "details": "This is a copy of https://pypi.org/project/play-scraper/ with added a very questionable \"telemetry\": in scraper.py, L90 sends the user hostname, IP and the exact local ID of scraped application to the package author.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research & co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2024-09-old-google-play-store\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n - dependency-confusion\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n - The package is a clone of a real package, but with malicious code added.",
