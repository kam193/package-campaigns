The last version was 0.1.1 published as a source package. Years later, the same name was registered by another user, who managed to publish a wheel package of version 0.1.1 as it's not prohibited to upload alternative build packages for existing versions. This hijacked version was an empty package. In 0.1.2, a beacon webhook was added. \n\nMore context: https://github.com/kam193/package-campaigns/issues/5",
