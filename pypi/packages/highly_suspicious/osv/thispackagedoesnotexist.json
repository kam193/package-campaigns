    "details": "Packages contain potentially malicious, RAT-like functionality (creating reverse shell, stealing cookies, etc.), but do not run it. It could be a preparation for something or building a red-team-like tools\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-01-denisemyname9\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - exfiltration-browser-data\n\n\n - exfiltration-generic\n\n\n - backdoor\n\n\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n\n\n - The package contains code to execute remote commands (probably limited to a specific set) on the victim's machine.\n\n",
