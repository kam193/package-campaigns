    "details": "The package seems to be hiding the potentially malicious possibility to download and execute remote code from a pre-defined host, but requires a specific key to do so. The relevant Github repository seems to host only versions without the remote code execution.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-10-starexx\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.\n\n",
