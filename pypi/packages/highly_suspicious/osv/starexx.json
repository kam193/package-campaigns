The relevant Github repository seems to host only versions without the remote code execution.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\nCampaign: 2025-10-starexx\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - {'description': 'Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.'}",
