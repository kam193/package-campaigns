Especially, the only thing the package \"tracks\" is the private key, which could eventually be masked.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-11-wallet-tracking\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - crypto-related\n\n\n - exfiltration-crypto\n\n",
