The package itself looks not attractive enough to be malicious alone, but at the moment the full scenario isn't known.\n\nHowever, creating a few similar packages and the random users name looks enough suspicious to assume the malicious intention. \n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\nCampaign: 2024-12-tonki\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - {'theme': 'info', 'description': 'A Telegram webhook is used to send collected data.'}\n - {}",
