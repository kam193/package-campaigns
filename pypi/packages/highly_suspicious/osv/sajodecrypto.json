Importing the package starts the code (L4+) that saves the embedded ZIP and runs it through Python. The __main__ file in the ZIP is also obfuscated attempts to run the compiled ARM-code.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\nCampaign: 2025-01-Sajode\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - obfuscation",
