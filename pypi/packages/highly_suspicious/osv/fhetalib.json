    "details": "Before starting the local application, the package sends the external IP to a static remote address, without the user confirmation.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-12-fhetalib\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n",
