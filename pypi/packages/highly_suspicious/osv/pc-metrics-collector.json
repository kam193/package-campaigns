However, it could also be a first version of a package dedicated for PC monitoring \n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\nCampaign: 2024-11-pc-metrics-collector\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username.
