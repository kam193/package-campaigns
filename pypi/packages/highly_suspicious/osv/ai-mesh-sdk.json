    "details": "Package references \"AI Mesh Platform\" but it's difficult to identify such a service (there is nothing that use exactly that name). It uses a cloudfront domain as a backend service and does not have proper author's email or repository URL, although it's said to be MIT-licensed. \n\nThe package looks like an attempt to collect credentials to a platform, but it's impossible to identify the targeted service or to conclude that it's a legit SDK.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\nCampaign: 2025-08-ai-mesh-sdk\nReasons (based on the campaign):",
