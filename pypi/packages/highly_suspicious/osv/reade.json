However, the file is not included in the package, which indicates either an issue during packaging or preparing for a usage as dependency. \n\nDue to lack of the file, it's not possible to 100% determine intentions.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-07-reade\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.\n\n",
