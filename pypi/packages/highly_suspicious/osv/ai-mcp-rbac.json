    "summary": "Highly suspicious code in ai-mcp-rbac (PyPI)",
    "details": "Code is heavily obfuscated with PyArmor. While it may be used for some kind of intellectual property protection, packages  also have other risk marks:\n- Obfuscation is done with the trial PyArmor version\n- Although obfuscated, it's distributed under the MIT license\n- There is no identification of the author, all names are very generic\n- all URLs are invalid (repository, homepage)\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-12-aicloudforge\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n",
