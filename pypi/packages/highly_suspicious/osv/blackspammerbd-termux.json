    "details": "The code is designed to exfiltrate files from Android devices to a Telegream channel.  \n\nPrevious similarly named packages used obfuscation and didn't contain automated triggers nor hardcoded Telegram credentials.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-04-blackspammerbd-vx1\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - files-exfiltration\n\n\n - peristence-autorun\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n",
