    "details": "Very suspicious packages, looking like an attempt to impersonate Akamai. During import, there is a call to canary token URL, but no other visible malicious activity. They contain some small helpers that can be useful, but do not look like a normal SDK.\n\nPackages were created by a different account than any previous official Akamai packages (e.g. https://pypi.org/project/edgegrid-python/) and the corresponding GitHub account (https://github.com/akamai-packages) although it claims to be the official one, is 1) user not an org, 2) different from the  Akamai organisation hosting previous Akamai repositories (https://github.com/akamai)\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\nCampaign: 2025-06-akamai-packages\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - impersonation\n - typosquatting\n - other",
