In addition, while it's hard to check what exactly the library is doing, it references the Github gist page\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-07-nexlang\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - modify-system-without-consent\n\n\n - other\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n",
