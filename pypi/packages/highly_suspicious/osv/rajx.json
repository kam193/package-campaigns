    "details": "The package provides little to no functionality, but contains obfuscated code that could destroy a user's filesystem. Older versions contained exfiltrating of files. However, no action is done automatically, and it's hard to clearly assess the intentions.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: GENERIC-other-risky\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n",
