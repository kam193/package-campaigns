The deobfuscated code appears not to have some suspicious activities, but no obvious malicious actions against the user - looks like a client to some online service, eventually designed to abuse it.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\nCampaign: 2025-06-encryptionyg\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - {'theme': 'warning'}",
