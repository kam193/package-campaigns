    "details": "A series of packages that promise an MCP server, but their only activity is to create a file in the user's directory. The MCP server is imitated by sleeping loop. \n\nThey were most probably created to research dependency confusion or other potentially malicious activity.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: HIGHLY_SUSPICIOUS - Packages that are likely malicious, but due to the obfuscation level, lack of time or clear indicators it's hard to say what exactly they do; the highest risk of false positives.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-10-sicksec-mcp\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n\n - iritating-computer-activity\n\n",
