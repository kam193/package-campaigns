    "description": "The package appears to be a PoC of overwriting \"requests\" package files. The new \"requests/__init__.py\" takes over common requests features and uses the implementation that a) logs every request to a file (but no external exfiltration, this may also be expected in some situations); b) after every 5 requests, opens the calculator app. The second shows clearly that the intention is to present a security risk, not create a real package."
