    "description": "Package imitates the legitimate fake-useragent, however it has a few suspicious additions: fake.py L149 calls a function from 'urllib2' module, which contains a code attempting to JSON-deserialize encoded code. This is a pickle executing os.system(id), which of course isn't executed by json.loads, but would be by pickle. Also: action is suspicious, not really malicious, but the package is a clear typosquatting attempt."
