    "description": "Package performs a \"backup\" of files to a remote location. This functionality is clearly described, but the user has no control over the remote location where the collected files are sent, as well as gets no access data. They are uploaded to a hardcoded Gofile account and as the downloading links are not saved anywhere, only the package author has access to them. "
