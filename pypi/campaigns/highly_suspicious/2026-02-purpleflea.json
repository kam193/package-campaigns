    "description": "Package to use the API of Purpleflea.com, a very suspicious financial service for LLM agents, offering high-risk services like gambling, using only cryptocurrencies as the payment method. At the time of analysis, the domain was 6 days old. The service profile matches emerging threats targeting LLM agents, but it's not clear if there is anything malicious, or it's just a high-risk service."
