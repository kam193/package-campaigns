    "description": "Package references \"AI Mesh Platform\" but it's difficult to identify such a service (there is nothing that use exactly that name). It uses a cloudfront domain as a backend service and does not have proper author's email or repository URL, although it's said to be MIT-licensed. \n\nThe package looks like an attempt to collect credentials to a platform, but it's impossible to identify the targeted service or to conclude that it's a legit SDK."
