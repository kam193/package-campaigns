    "description": "Running the installed entry point downloads and executes remote code. During the analysis, the code was switching to websockets, adding a startup script and downloading next stages, which finally looked for browser and crypto wallet data. Currently, they seem not to attempt exfiltration of very sensitive data but rather a presence of different webbrowsers and wallets.\n\nIt uses the same remote domain as campaign 2025-07-db-indicator, but significantly different payload."
