    "description": "Malicious copy of a standard library module that during class initialization downloads and executes remote code and after that attempts to cover its tracks by overwriting itself with non-malicious code. The remote code aims to collect and exfiltrate sensitive Telegram session files.\n\nThis campaign shares infrastructure and basic methods with previous 2025-11-uzip campaign. "
