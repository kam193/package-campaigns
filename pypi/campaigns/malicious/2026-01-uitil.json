    "description": "The package implements an undocumented way to execute code hidden in image files, and a function that searches for images in the current directory and attempts to execute the code. \n\nIt's used in the GitHub repository https://github.com/OR-6/PassCheck/blob/main/main.py#L190 to silently execute the command hidden in the image https://github.com/OR-6/PassCheck/blob/b09b3f1ec5d7345c614b1d956840ee2774f7131b/demo.png  when the user interacts with the repository code. The decrypted command attempted to download and execute code from hxxps://or-6.github[.]io, which at the time of analysis didn't host any code."
