    "description": "By using the package, the computer is attached to participate in a proxy network and share its IP and bandwidth. This is clearly stated, but the package has no real functionality besides that. Additionally, the stated proxy network seems extremely shady: the domain was just registered, is closely similar to a long-existing service, and offers residential proxy only for cryptocurrencies. The company mentioned in the package information does not have a website, and the proposed way to opt-out does not work."
