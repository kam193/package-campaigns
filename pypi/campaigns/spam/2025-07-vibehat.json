    "description": "While dependency confusion is a serious thing, I don't think the solution is to register every possible generic name that could exist in local repositories or imports... (or be generated by AI? This seems to be AI-related thing).\n\nThis package (and others from this user) has no real content and seems to be generated by a tool https://github.com/jvlax/vibehat to prevent \"dependency confusion\", but the scanner takes every local dependency and every non-relative import (https://github.com/jvlax/vibehat/blob/eed43b24b17ba393efc1b4e06aa7f9413559831a/backend/github_scanner.py#L345)."
