# Collection of malicious & suspicious packages

This is a collection of campaigns targeting package ecosystems, currently
limited to [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

Data are sourced (with small exceptions) from what I've seen in my analysing lab
 and are exported here periodically. The classification is mostly arbitrary and
 may not follow any strict criteria.

All published packages have been manually checked.

!!! notice
    The web representation is a WIP.

## Content

Packages are grouped in campaigns, which describe the activity. At the moment,
there is no additional description on the package level. As sometimes the
behaviour changes over time, the campaign description may not describe exactly
the package behaviour.

The current focus is on packages that are created for malicious purposes, and
not on hacked versions of legitimate packages. As so, there is currently
no information about specific versions.

## Disclaimer

Data are presented as-is without any guarantee. Detection, classification,
analyse & co. are done as a hobby activity, you use the information at your own
risk. There are possible mistakes or highly opinionated classifications.
